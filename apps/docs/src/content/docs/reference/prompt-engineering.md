description: "A guide to how Large Language Models (LLMs) and GitHub Copilot were utilized to accelerate and enhance the development of the Tau project."
---

The development of Tau has been significantly augmented by the strategic use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot. This document details our approach to prompt engineering and how these tools contributed to various aspects of the project, from initial design to implementation and documentation.

## Core Philosophy: AI as a Collaborator

Our approach views LLMs and Copilot not as replacements for developer expertise, but as powerful collaborators. They excel at:
-   **Accelerating mundane tasks:** Reducing time spent on boilerplate and repetitive code.
-   **Providing alternative perspectives:** Offering different solutions or ways to structure code.
-   **Facilitating learning:** Helping developers quickly grasp new concepts or library usages.
-   **Jumpstarting creative processes:** Assisting in brainstorming and initial drafting.

Effective use requires clear communication (good prompts), critical evaluation of suggestions, and a solid understanding of the underlying technologies.

## General LLM Usage (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

Beyond direct code generation, general-purpose LLMs were employed for a variety of tasks:

### 1. Brainstorming and Architectural Design
LLMs helped explore different architectural patterns and feature implementations early in the project.
-   **Example Prompt (High-Level Design):** "We're building a modular web application called Tau, focusing on interview scheduling and management. Suggest a micro-frontend vs. monolithic frontend architecture. What are the pros and cons for a small team aiming for rapid iteration initially, but scalability later?"
-   **Example Prompt (Feature Specific):** "For Tau's interview slot selection, what are some intuitive UI/UX approaches for interviewers to mark their availability across different time zones? Consider potential edge cases like recurring availability."
-   **Example Prompt (Problem Solving):** "What are common challenges and solutions for synchronizing session state between a Next.js frontend and a separate backend API, especially when dealing with server-side rendering and client-side navigation?"

### 2. Code Explanation and Documentation
Understanding complex code snippets or generating initial drafts for documentation was streamlined.
-   **Example Prompt (Code Understanding):** "Explain this TanStack Query `useSuspenseQuery` hook usage in the context of fetching interview round data. What does `select: (d) => interviewRound.from(d)` achieve here? `[paste relevant code from schedule.tsx]`"
-   **Example Prompt (Documentation Draft):** "Generate a markdown section explaining how to use the `Scheduler` component in Tau. It accepts `slots`, `onCreateSlot`, `onSlotClick`, and `interviewRound` props. Briefly describe each prop and provide a simple usage example."

### 3. Generating Boilerplate and Utility Functions
LLMs sped up the creation of repetitive structures.
-   **Example Prompt (React Component):** "Generate a React functional component named `ConfirmationModal` using `@tau/ui` components (Button, Dialog). It should take `isOpen`, `onClose`, `onConfirm`, `title`, and `message` props. The confirm button should be styled as primary, and cancel as secondary."
-   **Example Prompt (Utility Function):** "Write a TypeScript utility function `formatDateRange(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): string` that returns a human-readable string like 'June 5, 2025, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM'. Handle cases where start and end are on the same day."

### 4. Debugging and Error Resolution
LLMs provided insights into cryptic error messages or suggested debugging strategies.
-   **Example Prompt (Error Analysis):** "My React component using `useScheduleInterview` hook is throwing a 'mutateAsync is not a function' error. Here's the hook definition `[paste hook code]` and its usage `[paste component code]`. What are common reasons for this with TanStack Mutation?"
-   **Example Prompt (Logic Debugging):** "In my `handleCreateSlot` function, the overlap detection logic seems to be failing for slots that end exactly when another begins. Can you review this logic and suggest improvements? `[paste overlap detection code from schedule.tsx]`"

### 5. Refactoring and Code Optimization
LLMs offered suggestions for improving code structure, readability, and performance.
-   **Example Prompt (Refactoring):** "This TypeScript function for filtering interview slots has become complex. `[paste function code]`. Can you suggest ways to refactor it for better readability and maintainability, perhaps by breaking it into smaller functions or using more descriptive variable names?"
-   **Example Prompt (Performance):** "Review this data transformation logic for the `Scheduler` component. Are there any potential performance bottlenecks if we have hundreds of slots? `[paste relevant data mapping code]`"

## GitHub Copilot: In-Editor Assistance

GitHub Copilot, integrated directly into VS Code, provided continuous, context-aware assistance.

### 1. Autocompletion and Code Generation
Copilot's primary strength lies in its ability to predict and complete lines or blocks of code.
-   **Contextual Suggestions:** Based on the current file, imported modules, and surrounding code, Copilot suggests relevant completions. For instance, after typing `const [slots, setSlots] = React.useState(`, Copilot would likely suggest `slotsQuery.data);` based on the patterns in `schedule.tsx`.
-   **Boilerplate Reduction:** Writing import statements, setting up component props, or initializing state variables became much faster.
-   **Implementing Similar Patterns:** When adding a new field to a form or a new case to a switch statement, Copilot quickly picks up the existing pattern.

### 2. Writing Comments to Guide Copilot
We found that writing descriptive comments before a function or a complex block of code significantly improved the quality of Copilot's suggestions.
-   **Example Comment:**
    ```typescript
    // filepath: /home/stefantacu/github/tau/apps/app/app/routes/app/interview-rounds/$roundId/schedule.tsx
    // ...existing code...
    // Check if the new slot (start to slotEndTime) overlaps with any existing slot
    // An overlap occurs if:
    // 1. The new slot's start time is within an existing slot.
    // 2. The new slot's end time is within an existing slot.
    // 3. The new slot completely envelops an existing slot.
    const hasOverlap = slots.some((existingSlot) => {
      // ... Copilot would then be more likely to generate the correct comparison logic ...
    });
    // ...existing code...
    ```

### 3. Unit Test Generation
Copilot assisted in scaffolding unit tests, suggesting test cases and mock implementations.
-   **Example (Conceptual):** After writing a utility function, typing `describe('[functionName]', () => { it('should [test case description]', () => {` would often lead Copilot to suggest relevant assertions.
-   **Example Prompt (as a comment for Copilot):** `// Write a unit test for the handleCreateSlot function. Mock api.interviewRounds.queries.id and slotsQuery.data. Test that a new slot is added to the state and hasUnsavedChanges is true.`

### 4. Learning and Discovery
Copilot sometimes suggested APIs or language features that developers might not have been immediately aware of, acting as a passive learning tool.

## Specific Use Cases & Prompt Examples in Tau

-   **Initial `Scheduler` Component Logic (`schedule.tsx`):**
    -   *Copilot Comment Prompt:* `// Function to handle creating a new slot. It should check for overlaps with existing slots based on roundQuery.data.duration.`
    -   *LLM Prompt (for overlap logic):* "Generate TypeScript logic to check if a new time interval (start, end) overlaps with a list of existing time intervals, each defined by a start time and a fixed duration."

-   **API Route Handlers (`apps/app/app/lib/api/`):**
    -   *Copilot Comment Prompt (e.g., in a new API file):* `// Create a server function to fetch interview slots for a given roundId and interviewer_email. Use drizzle to query the 'interviewSlots' table.`
    -   *LLM Prompt (for complex queries):* "I need a Drizzle ORM query for PostgreSQL to select interview slots. The query should filter by `interview_round_id` and `interviewer_email`. Also, include the related `interviewRounds` data, specifically the `duration`."

-   **UI Component Styling with Tailwind CSS (`packages/ui/src/`):**
    -   *Copilot (inline):* Typing `className="flex items-center` would often lead Copilot to suggest `justify-between p-4` if similar patterns exist.
    -   *LLM Prompt (for complex layouts):* "Provide Tailwind CSS classes to create a responsive card layout with an image on the left and text content (title, description, tags) on the right. On small screens, the image should stack above the text."

-   **Documentation Snippets (like this file!):**
    -   *LLM Prompt:* "Draft an introduction for a markdown document explaining how LLMs and GitHub Copilot were used in a software project named Tau. Emphasize collaboration and productivity gains."

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

-   **Be Specific and Provide Context:** The more detailed your prompt, the better the output. Mention technologies, desired output format, and constraints.
-   **Iterate:** Don't expect the perfect answer on the first try. Refine your prompts based on the responses. Ask follow-up questions.
-   **Define the Persona/Role:** Sometimes, asking the LLM to act as a "senior software engineer" or "UX expert" can tailor the response style.
-   **Request Examples:** Ask for code snippets or examples to illustrate concepts.
-   **Specify Output Format:** Request responses in markdown, JSON, or specific code languages.
-   **Break Down Complex Tasks:** For large problems, use multiple prompts to tackle smaller pieces.

## Challenges and Mitigations

-   **Accuracy and "Hallucinations":** LLM-generated code or information can be incorrect or subtly flawed.
    -   **Mitigation:** Always critically review and test all suggestions. Treat AI output as a draft, not a final product.
-   **Security Vulnerabilities:** AI might suggest code with security flaws.
    -   **Mitigation:** Maintain strong security review practices. Be especially cautious with prompts involving authentication, authorization, or data validation.
-   **Over-Reliance and Skill Atrophy:** Relying too heavily on AI can hinder deep learning and problem-solving skills.
    -   **Mitigation:** Use AI as a tool to augment, not replace, understanding. Actively engage with the suggestions and try to understand *why* they work.
-   **Context Window Limitations:** For very large codebases or complex histories, LLMs might lose context.
    -   **Mitigation:** Focus prompts on specific, well-defined problems. Provide relevant snippets rather than entire files if possible.
-   **Bias in Training Data:** LLMs can reflect biases present in their training data.
    -   **Mitigation:** Be aware of potential biases in suggestions, especially regarding non-technical aspects or when generating user-facing text.

By embracing LLMs and GitHub Copilot with a mindful and critical approach, the Tau team has been able to enhance productivity, explore creative solutions, and streamline various aspects of the software development lifecycle.
